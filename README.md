# nomad-firehose

`nomad-firehose` is a tool meant to enable teams to quickly build logic around nomad task events without hooking into Nomad API.

## Running

The project has build artifacts for Linux, Darwin and Windows in the [GitHub releases tab](https://github.com/seatgeek/nomad-firehose/releases).

A Docker container is also provided at [seatgeek/nomad-firehose](https://hub.docker.com/r/seatgeek/nomad-firehose/tags/)

## Requirements

- Go 1.11

## Building

To build a binary, run the following

```shell
# get this repo
go get github.com/seatgeek/nomad-firehose

# go to the repo directory
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/seatgeek/nomad-firehose

# build the `nomad-firehose` binary
make build
```

This will create a `nomad-firehose` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Configuration

Any `NOMAD_*` env that the native `nomad` CLI tool supports are supported by this tool.

Any `CONSUL_*` env that the native `consul` CLI tool supports are supported by this tool.

The most basic requirement is `export NOMAD_ADDR=http://<ip>:4646` and `export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=<ip>:8500`.

### Consul

`nomad-firehose` will use Consul to maintain leader-ship and store last event time processed (saved on quit or every 10s).

This mean you can run more than 1 process of each firehose, and only one will actually do any work.

Saving the last event time mean that restarting the process won't firehose all old changes to your sink, reducing duplicated events.

By default, the Consul lock is maintained in KV at `nomad-firehose/${type}.lock` and the last event time is stored in KV at `nomad-firehose/${type}.value`. You can change the prefix from `nomad-firehose` by setting `NOMAD_FIREHOSE_CONSUL_PREFIX` to your desired prefix.

#### Consul ACL Token Permissions

If the Consul cluster being used is running ACLs, the following ACL policy will allow the required access:

```hcl
key "nomad-firehose" {
  policy = "write"
}
session "" {
  policy = "write"
}
```

If you've set a custom prefix, specify that in the `key` ACL entry instead.

### Kafka

### Enable TLS to encrypt data in transit
To enable TLS communication between client and broker set `SINK_KAFKA_ENABLE_TLS` to `true`. Note that this will be enabled automatically by using [TLS client authentication](#tls)

### Client authentication
#### TLS
To connect to Kafka with TLS authentication, set the `SINK_KAFKA_CA_CERT_PATH` to the path to your CA cert file.

#### User/password
To use SASL/PLAIN authentication, set `$SINK_KAFKA_USER` and `$SINK_KAFKA_PASSWORD` environment variables.


## Usage

The `nomad-firehose` binary has several helper subcommands.

The sink type is configured using `$SINK_TYPE` environment variable. Valid values are:
- `amqp`
- `kinesis`
- `nsq`
- `redis`
- `kafka`
- `mongo`
- `sqs`
- `eventbridge`
- `stdout`
- `syslog`

The `amqp` and `rabbitmq` sinks are configured using `$SINK_AMQP_CONNECTION` (`amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/`), `$SINK_AMQP_EXCHANGE`, `$SINK_AMQP_ROUTING_KEY`, and `$SINK_AMQP_WORKERS` (default: `1`) environment variables.

The `http` sink is configured using `$SINK_HTTP_ADDRESS` (`localhost:8080/allocations`)` environment variable.

The `kafka` sink is configured using `$SINK_KAFKA_BROKERS` (`kafka1:9092,kafka2:9092,kafka3:9092`), and `$SINK_KAFKA_TOPIC` environment variables.

The `kinesis` sink is configured using `$SINK_KINESIS_STREAM_NAME` and `$SINK_KINESIS_PARTITION_KEY` environment variables.

The `mongo` sink is configured using `$SINK_MONGODB_CONNECTION` (`mongodb://localhost:27017/`), `$SINK_MONGODB_DATABASE` and `$SINK_MONGODB_COLLECTION` environment variables.

The `nsq` sink is configured using `$SINK_NSQ_ADDR` and `$SINK_NSQ_TOPIC_NAME` environment variables.

The `redis` sink is configured using `$SINK_REDIS_URL` (`redis://[user]:[password]@127.0.0.1[:5672]/0`) and `$SINK_REDIS_KEY` environment variables.

The `stdout` sink does not have any configuration, it will simply output the JSON to stdout for debugging.

The `syslog` sink is configured using `$SINK_SYSLOG_PROTO` (e.g. `tcp`, `udp` - leave empty if logging to a local syslog socket), `$SINK_SYSLOG_ADDR` (e.g. `127.0.0.1:514` - leave empty if logging to a local syslog socket), and `$SINK_SYSLOG_TAG` (default: `nomad-firehose`).

The `sqs` sink is configured using `$SINK_SQS_QUEUE_NAME` which is the name of the queue in SQS. This queue is expected to be a FIFO queue.
The URL of the queue is inferred by the presence of the `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` env variables.

The `eventbridge` sink is configured using `$SINK_EVENT_BUS_NAME` which is the name of the bus in Event Bridge. The environment variables `SINK_EVENT_BUS_DETAIL_TYPE` and `SINK_EVENT_BUS_SOURCE` are used to configure the schema when creating Event Bus rules.

### `allocations`

`nomad-firehose allocations` will monitor all allocation changes in the Nomad cluster and emit each task state as a new firehose event to the configured sink.

The allocation output is different from the [default API response](https://www.nomadproject.io/api/allocations.html), as the tool will emit an event per new [TaskStates](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/http/allocs.html), rather than all the previous events.
