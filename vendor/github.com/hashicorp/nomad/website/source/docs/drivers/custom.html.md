  Create custom task drivers for Nomad.

# Custom Drivers

Nomad does not currently support pluggable task drivers, however the
interface that a task driver must implement is minimal. In the short term,
custom drivers can be implemented in Go and compiled into the binary,
however in the long term we plan to expose a plugin interface such that
task drivers can be dynamically registered without recompiling the Nomad binary.
